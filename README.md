# PyCalculator
Just a simple calculator

## Intro

Just a simple calculator to play with the Tkinter library and also testing out some of Python's special methods in classes.
The calculator keeps track of previous calculations just like normal calculators on your OS would.

Original design idea taken from [DJ Oamen's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtw9CfTfMKU9aHZsT2teYg) tutorial 
["How to Create Calculator in Python - Full Tutorial"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WPmxH4RRZ0)

Did the design a bit differently in the code to dynamically create some of the buttons using a nested list with dictionaries to hold the
attributes for each button.

## Run application
```python
python CalcFinal.py
```
